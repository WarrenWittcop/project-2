Title: Might and Magic 7 Character Creator

 This is a simple app that lets you see the various choices available, starting attributes by race,  and create a character. The main point is to use this app to plan ahead so when you are able to play the game youu already have the choices and don't waste valuable playtime comparing and researching skills.

Tech Used:

HTML, CSS, Embedded Javascript, Mongoose, MongoDB, Express, Node.js, Materialize collapsible code.


Getting Started:

website: https://git.heroku.com/mm7-character-maker.git or can fork and clone the app from Github directly at: https://github.com/WarrenWittcop/project-2.

If you fork and clone to download the app using Node.js and Gitbash the npms I used were: 1. npm i express -- install express
2. npm init -y -- install package json
3. npm install ejs -- install ejs file usage   (Embedded JavaScript)
4. npm install method-override -- install methodoverride
5. npm i mongoose -- get Mongoose going

Once you have installed the needed npms or accessed directly you are taken to the login page. From there just sign up if you haven't already to get logged in. After log-in at the top of every page are 3 links, Home which takes you to the Index page that shows created characters. Create a character which takes youu to the create page. Lastly, logout which will sign uou ouut and take you back to the Login screen.

On any page logged in you can see the catalog of the skills and magic in the game with a brief description to guide your choice. Any character made on the create screen will be saved locally and show on the Home/ Index page. From the home you can edit any facet youu selected about your character or delete them. 


Planned future enhancements:

1. I plan to implement drop downs for all skill selection -- possibly nested to avoid having to type it in (limited by class).

2. Add a table for the max level of the skills.
