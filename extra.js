// put in code so index does not populate character data if they did not create it
if currentUser then make a variable called  createdBy attach to whatever function-- new, index, edit?
make sure the createdBy is defined and attach to characterData-- schema? 
 else  it wont call the characterData and treat it like new--- not saved locally saved in the mongodb
